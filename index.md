# Introduction
This is the blog of my C++ Programming project on Digital Rain. The aim of this project was to create a digital rain as seen in the movie "The Matrix". 
I used the object oriented programming style in this project. This is what the final product looks like:

# Design and Test


# The Algorithm


# Problem Solving


# Modern C++ insight & reflection



Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.
