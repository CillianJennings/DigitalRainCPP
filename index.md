# Introduction
This is the blog of my C++ Programming project on Digital Rain. The aim of this project was to create a digital rain as seen in the movie "The Matrix". 
I used the object oriented programming style in this project. This is what the final product looks like:

# Design and Test
The design of this project was assisted by ai tools, where I discovered console screen buffering or double buffering, [Microsoft Screen Buffering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/createconsolescreenbuffer).
This works by creating two seperate memory buffers, one is visible (active buffer) while the other (inactive buffer) is used for drawing the next frame.
Once the new frame is completely drawn in the inactive buffer,
The purpose of double buffering it to eliminate flickering in the console. My first version of digital rain was very flickery and not very pleasant to look at, and double buffering solved that.
